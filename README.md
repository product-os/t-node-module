# Node module type
Template repository for creating a new type for use with Transformers

To create a new repo from this template [click here](https://github.com/organizations/product-os/repositories/new). (For some reason templates only show up when clicking "new repo" within the same org although they can then be used to create a repo in any org you have access to...)
